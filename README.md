### Project Description
- Pitch: People often have a million tabs up and lose track of what they were doing. This website lets you organize them in to-do lists and make a note of why it was important. Makes it easy to pick up where you left off. 

#### MVP Feature Breakdown:

- Login/Signup Pages: A mentor can login into an existing account with Username, and Password and a Phone Number or a user can sign up for an account with a username, and password and phone number. An e-mail address should be connected with an account creation.

- Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

- Home Page: on login a user is sent to a list view page where they can see a list of their recent tabs they’ve saved, organized into categories they’ve created.

- Tab saving page: (modal or new page) User can add the link to their tab, a note about it, and a tag to organize it into an existing or new category.  Clicking submit adds the tab to the correct category (or uncategorized) on the home page.

- Edit a saved tab page

- Delete tab - Modal confirming the action, on confirmation user is routed back to the home page and tab is gone.

- Tab category page: Shows a list and website preview of each tab saved, along with description user gave for that tab. Clicking the tab link takes you to that website.
